## Platform Engineer | DevOps | SysAdmin | Python Dev | Git/GitLab-ci | k8s | IaC | Cloud | Linuxers

### Professional Summary

Systems Analyst from the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco (UFRPE) and specialized in Software Engineering from the International University Center (UNINTER). A native of the Linux environment (Debian, RHEL), I have significant experience in infrastructure, support, networks, containers (docker, cri-o, podman, containerd), orchestration (kubernetes), troubleshooting, and observability (ELK, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki). I use languages like Python and Bash to create solutions in Bare-Metal or Cloud (GCP, AWS) environments that, using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible) and pipelines (GitOps), to automate severals computational processes (k8s, serverless, hosts).

Over the years, I have collaborated with severals companies (private and public, domestic and international) in various segments of computer science, gaining experience in:
- SysAdmin, Computer Networks, Linux Administration in institutions such as SESI, Ministry of Communications
- Educator/Professor at ITEP, UFRPE, FIS, IFBaiano
- Software Engineer at tag.i, 3Ecologias, IFBaiano
- DevOps Engineer at nash.io

In 2020, at the invitation of Professor Fábio dos Santos Lima from the Federal Institute of Bahiano Science and Technology (IFBaiano), I managed the project for the development and operations of a Police Occurrence Registry platform (ROP-E) in partnership with IFBaiano and the Military Police of Bahia (PM-BA). Leading a team of developers (backend, frontend, mobile), we delivered in early 2021 a platform consisting of a Web interface (Python, Django), an API (Django Rest API), and a mobile interface (VueJS) operating in containers (Docker) with replicated databases using Postgres in the Cloud (DigitalOcean).

Im join at the nash.io DevOps Team in 2021 at the invitation of Alexandre Mulatinho, to the Infrastructure and Operations scenario, acting with high availability, cloud and bare-metal computing, microservices, orchestration, CI/CD, blockchain networks, automation, IaC, observability, as well as offering support to backend, frontend, QA, compliance teams, and maintaining all company environments (development and production).

Currently, I enjoy solving problems in GNU/Linux, designing, building, and maintaining Kubernetes clusters in operations, preferably starting from some pipeline in a completely secure environment with Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery.
